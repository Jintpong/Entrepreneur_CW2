## What is our unique selling proposition (USP)? 
While there are several platforms that provide property-related data, most tend to focus narrowly on specific user groups—such as developers or landlords—or suffer from usability and accessibility issues, especially for individual buyers or first-time investors.
ScuderiaEstate stands out by combining comprehensive data coverage, intuitive design, and affordable pricing—all in one place.
The following comparison table highlights how our platform distinguishes itself from key competitors in the market.

## Risks and Challenges (yuta editting)

Through interviews with several potential customers, concerns were raised regarding Data Security, Privacy, and Fraud Risk in relation to our business.
Our platform targets overseas real estate investors and handles both financial transactions and personal information.
There is a risk that malicious users could impersonate others, or that our platform could be exploited for money laundering or the movement of funds by criminal organizations.
Failure to address these risks could result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and even orders to cease business operations.
