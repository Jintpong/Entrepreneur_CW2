### Properties Price Trends in London and Opportunities 
Figure 1 demonstrated the annual changes in prime London propert from 2013 to 2023. It clearly showcased the market fluctuations which demonstrated the volatile nature of the London housing market.  Understanding these trends is essential for making informed decisions for real estate agents, property developers, and home buyers or sellers. Real estate agents can time listings and set competitive prices, developers can assess growth areas and market timing, and buyers or sellers can evaluate the best moments to transact. Therefore, ScuderiaEstate addresses the key pain points across these sectors by delivering AI-powered insights and predictive analytics—empowering users to make faster, data-driven decisions based on real-time pricing trends and market dynamics.

## What is our unique selling proposition (USP)? 
While there are several platforms that provide property-related data, most tend to focus narrowly on specific user groups—such as developers or landlords—or suffer from usability and accessibility issues, especially for individual buyers or first-time investors.
ScuderiaEstate stands out by combining comprehensive data coverage, intuitive design, and affordable pricing—all in one place.

## Risks and Challenges (yuta editting)

Through interviews with several potential customers, concerns were raised regarding Data Security, Privacy, and Fraud Risk in relation to our business.
Our platform targets overseas real estate investors and handles both financial transactions and personal information.
There is a risk that malicious users could impersonate others, or that our platform could be exploited for money laundering or the movement of funds by criminal organizations.
Failure to address these risks could result in legal penalties, reputational damage, and even orders to cease business operations.

To mitigate these risks, we will implement a robust KYC process to verify the identities of our users and prevent unauthorized access and illicit activity.
By doing so, we aim to comply with GDPR and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations, and build trust with our customers.
![Presentation2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0f45abd-f9b3-4e95-bb84-b1dca0f95efb)

Furthermore, using AI technology, we will continuously monitor transactions for unusual activity and report to authorities as necessary.
This will provide a safe and secure trading environment for users.
We will also properly collect, store, and protect customer personal data in full compliance with GDPR.

According to Chainalysis(https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/what-is-aml-and-kyc-for-crypto/#why-kyc), implementing KYC does not significantly reduce the number of users, demonstrating that illegal usage can be prevented without harming user acquisition, allowing businesses to expand globally.

Additionally, according to CipherTrace, Inc., exchanges operating in countries with weak AML regulations receive 36 times more illicit Bitcoin deposits and send 18 times more illicit funds compared to those in countries with strict regulations.( CipherTrace, CipherTrace, Inc., “Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report - Q3 2018)
This indicates that adhering to AML and CFT (Counter Financing of Terrorism) regulations can greatly reduce criminal risks.
